Catching Crooks in the sea is a machine learning project done by me (Vaishnavi Muley) and two of my friends (Manali Bansode and Yash Khule) in which based on the data of ship being active in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 we predict whether the ship was be active in 2016 or not.

1. Yash did the front end part
2. Manali did data collection, preprocessing and analysis
3. I did model building, training and built flask application

Catching_Crooks_Project.ipynb is a jupyter notebook which will cover Data preprocessing, analysis, model building, model training in detail.

If, you want to run the application download the data set named fishing_vessels_v1.csv then, create a Templates folder in which download and keep Catching_Crooks.html file, create a static folder in which keep all your static files like CSS/Js files and images, then download Catching_Crooks.py file which contain model building part after running which a .pkl file will be created then download Catching_Crooks_App.py file which contains the flask application code and after running which you are all set to go.

The application takes input from users for ship being active in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in Yes/No format and then predicts whether the ship was active in 2016 or not.
